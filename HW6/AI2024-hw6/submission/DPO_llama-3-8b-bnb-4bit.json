If 15 pears were added, and half of the oranges were removed, what would be the new ratio of oranges to apples, bananas, and pears combined within the basket?\n\n### Response:\nThe ratio would be 3 oranges to 10 apples, bananas, and pears combined.\n\n### Explanation:\nThis question is asking for the ratio between oranges and the combined amount of apples, bananas, and pears. In order to answer this question, we must first calculate the amount of oranges, apples, bananas, and pears. We start by adding the pears. Then, we remove half of the oranges. Finally, we calculate the ratio between the oranges and the combined amount of apples, bananas, and pears. We divide the amount of oranges by the amount of apples, bananas, and pears. Then, we round the quotient to the nearest whole number. \n\n### Answer: \nThe ratio would be 3 oranges to 10 apples, bananas, and pears combined."
